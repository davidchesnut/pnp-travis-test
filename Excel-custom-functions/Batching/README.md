# Custom function batching pattern 

If your custom functions call a remote service you may want to use a batching pattern to reduce the number of network calls to the remote service. This is useful when a spreadsheet recalculates and it contains many of your custom functions. Recalculate will result in many calls to your custom functions, but you can batch them into one or a few calls to the remote service.

### Applies to ###
-  Custom functions on Excel desktop and online

### Prerequisites ###
To get set up and working with custom functions, see [Custom functions requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/excel/custom-functions-requirements)

## Scenario: Custom function batching

In this scenario your custom functions call a remote service. To reduce network round trips you will batch all the calls and send them in a single call to the web service. This is ideal when the spreadsheet is recalculated. For example, if someone used your custom function in 100 cells in a spreadsheet, and then recalculates the spreadsheet, your custom function would run 100 times and make 100 network calls. By using this batching pattern, the calls can be combined to make all 100 calculations in a single network call.

### Run the sample
To run this sample, download the code and go to the **Batching** folder in a command prompt window.

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run build`.
3. Run `npm run start`. The sample will now sideload into Excel on desktop.

### Key parts of the sample
The code pattern contains two custom functions named `DIV2` and `MUL2`. Instead of performing the calculation, each of them calls a `_pushOperation` function to push the operation into a batch queue to be passed to a web service.

```typescript
function mul2(first: number, second: number) {
  return _pushOperation(
    "mul2",
    [first, second]
  );
}
```

#### Batching the operation
The `_pushOperation` function pushes each operation into a _batch variable. It schedules the batch call to be made within 100 milliseconds. You can adjust this when using the code in your own solution.

```typescript
  // If a remote request hasn't been scheduled yet,
  // schedule it after a certain timeout, e.g. 100 ms.
  if (!_isBatchedRequestScheduled) {
    _isBatchedRequestScheduled = true;
    setTimeout(_makeRemoteRequest, 100);
  }
```

#### Making the remote request
The `_makeRemoteRequest` function prepares the batch request and passes it to the `_fetchFromRemoteService` function. If you are adapting this code to your own solution you need to modify `_makeRemoteRequest` to actually call your remote service.

#### The remote service
The `_fetchFromRemoteService` function processes the batch of operations, performs the operations, and then returns the results. In this sample, `_fetchFromRemoteService` is just another function to demonstrate the pattern. When adapting this code to your solution, use this method on the server-side to respond to the client call over the network.

### How to apply batching in your own solution
You can copy and paste this code into your own solution. When using this pattern, you'll need to evaluate and update the following areas of code.

#### _pushOperation
Adjust the timeout value as needed. A longer time will be more noticable to the user. A shorter time may result in more calls to the remote service.

#### _makeRemoteRequest
Modify this function to actually make a network call to your remote service and pass the batch operations in a single call. For example, you may want to serialize the batch entries into a JSON body to be passed in the netwwork call to the remote service.

#### _fetchFromRemoteService
Place this function in your remote service to handle the network call from the client. You'll want to modify this to perform the actual operations of your custom functions (or call the correct methods to do so.)

**Note**: You should remove the call to `pause(1000)` which simulates network latency in the sample.

### Security notes
When implementing the **_fetchFromRemoteService** function on a server, apply an appropriate authentication mechanism. Ensure that only the correct callers can access the function.

In the webpack.config.js file, a header is set to  `"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"`. This is only for development purposes. You should lock this header down to only allowed domains in production code.

You will be prompted to install self-signed certificates when you run this sample on your development computer. The certificates are intended only for running and studying this code sample. Do not reuse them in your own code solutions or in production environments.

You can install or uninstall the self-signed certificates by running the following commands in the project folder.

```cli
npx office-addin-dev-certs install
npx office-addin-dev-certs uninstall
```
